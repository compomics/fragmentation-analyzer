#summary Short summary of changes for the current build of Fragmentation Analyzer. (Note that this may not be the same as the released version.)

----
 
 * NEW FEATURE: All plots can now be exported as PDF, PNG, JPG and TIFF (in addition to the already supported SVG format).
 * NEW FEATURE: On Windows platforms FragmentationAnalyzer can now be ran from paths containing spaces.
 * BUG FIX: Plot title names containing < or > (mainly for modifications) will now be altered before suggesting them as export plot title. (In order to make the suggested file names valid).
 * LIBRARY UPDATE: `pdf-transcoder` and `xerces` added for SVG to PDF conversion.
