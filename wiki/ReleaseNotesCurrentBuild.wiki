#summary Short summary of changes for the current build of Fragmentation Analyzer. (Note that this may not be the same as the released version.)

----

 * NEW FEATURE: It is now possible to edit the title of the plots/analyses frames. 
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: The numbers in the results dialog are now formatted, e.g., 12345 becomes 12,345. 
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: The coloring scheme for bubble and scatter plots when using the fragment ion type label type is now the same as for fragment ion probability plots.
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: The combined fragment ion probability plots now ignore ions that can not be found for a given peptide, e.g., a y10 ion for a peptide of length 8 etc. (Earlier these were counted as a value of 0.) 
 * FEATURE IMPROVEMENT: The combined fragment ion probability plots now only use the average value for each peptide sequence to hinder that a more frequent peptide would influence the combined plot more than a less frequent peptide.
 * BUG FIX: Moved the Help menu to the far right in the menu bar.
