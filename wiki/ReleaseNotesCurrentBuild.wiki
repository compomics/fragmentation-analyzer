#summary Short summary of changes for the current build of Fragmentation Analyzer. (Note that this may not be the same as the released version.)

----

 * NEW FEATURE: The spectrum total intensity is now extracted from the ms_lims database (if avaiable) (requires ms_lims 7.1). This drastically decreased the time required to plot Mass Error Bubble Plots and Intensity Box Plots.
 * NEW FEATURE: The option of using the mass error threshold as the data label has been added (for ms_lims only). 
 * BUG FIX: Empty ms_lims data sets (and folder) are now deleted if the data extraction is canceled. 
 * BUG FIX: The progress bar shown when retrieving identifications from ms_lims no longer halts too long at 100%.
 * BUG FIX: The insert data set feature could result in an error if the folder contained non-valid data sets.
 * BUG FIX: The OK button in the database login dialog can now become enabled when pasting content into the fields and not just when typing.
